Lambda refers to functional programming

its like calling a method like a inline variable. 
lets say, String name = 'foo';
double pi = 3.14;
Similarly we are assigning a function/,method to a varaible and when the variable name is  called, the fucntion will be called
Piece of code becomes a value that gets assigned to a varaiable.
for ex., a method with block of code
public void perform(){
  System.out.print("Hello World");
}

To create lambda expression for the same,
remove public ( as public makes sense if its part of class, but in isolation the variable will be accessed by whoever has access)
remove method name as variable name will be used to access
remove return type - as from java 8 , java compiler can identify what the return type.
add ' -> ' in between paranthesis and block of code
so the final lambda expression for the above method is,

aBlockOfCode = () -> {  System.out.print("Hello World");}
If body of lambda expression is single line, then it can be also written as
aBlockOfCode = () -> System.out.print("Hello World");

so like a variable, we can pass it in method, for ex.,
if there is a method greet which takes aBlockOfCode,then
public void greet(aBlockOfCode){
   
}

greet method can be called as greet(aBlockOfCode) or greet(() -> System.out.print("Hello World"));

Another ex.,
To write a lambda expression that takes an argument and returns some value,
for ex., 
public int doubleNumberFunction(int a){return a *2};
can be written as lambdaexpression as,
doubleNumberFunction = (int a) -> a*2;

another ex.
addFunction = (int a, int b ) -> a+b;
divideFunction(int a, int b) -> {
 if(b == 0) return 0;
 return  a/b;
}

In divideFunction, {} - > is present because lambda expression is more tha  one line, also return is present becasue {} is present.
stringLengthFinder = (String s) -> s.length(); - returns length of s.

When creating lambda expression, the type should be declared as interface say for ex., for the below lambda expression,
aBlockOfCode = () -> {  System.out.print("Hello World");}
type should be , an interface with any name
interface myLambda(){ //interface name can be anything
  void myLamb(); //return type and number of arguments should be exactly same as the lambda expression
}
so the lambda expression should be,
myLamb aBlockOfCode = () -> {  System.out.print("Hello World");}
